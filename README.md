### Experiment 1: Decentralized Certificate Verification
## Aim:
  To develop a smart contract for issuing and verifying academic certificates on Ethereum, preventing forgery and ensuring authenticity.
## Algorithm:
### step 1:
Deploy a smart contract where universities can issue certificates.
### step 2:
Store a hash of certificate data on-chain.
### step 3:
Provide a verification function that checks certificate authenticity.
### step 4:
Users can verify the certificate by comparing the stored hash.

}

# Expected Output:
```
● When the university issues a certificate, it gets stored as a hash.
● A student or employer can verify the certificate by entering the details.
● If valid, it returns true; otherwise, false.
High-Level Overview:
● Used to prevent fake certificates.
● Enables quick verification by employers or other institutions.
● Shows how blockchain can be used in education and credential verification.
